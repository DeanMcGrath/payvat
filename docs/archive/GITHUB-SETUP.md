# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since GitHub CLI is not available, please follow these manual steps:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. **Create New Repository**: Click the "+" icon â†’ "New repository"
3. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Repository name**: `vat-pay-ireland`
   - **Description**: `Irish VAT Return Management System for businesses - Complete solution for VAT submission and payment processing`
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Private** (recommended for business application)
   - **Initialize**: Leave all checkboxes UNCHECKED (we have our own files)
4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Local Code to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
cd "/Users/deanmcgrath/PAY VAT"

# Add GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vat-pay-ireland.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`** with your actual GitHub username from the repository URL shown on GitHub.

## Step 3: Verify Push Success

After pushing, you should see all your files in the GitHub repository, including:
- Complete application code (154 files)
- README.md with full documentation  
- DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md
- All admin dashboard pages
- Complete API implementation

## What Happens Next

Once you've completed the GitHub push, I'll proceed with:
1. Vercel deployment and configuration
2. PostgreSQL database setup
3. Production environment variables
4. Testing and validation

Please complete these GitHub steps and let me know when the code is successfully pushed to GitHub!
